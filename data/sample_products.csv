Like the woman it represents- the fragrance is an intricate play of opposites. It is from this fusion of the unexpected- a mocha violet note- that it draws its appeal.The violet opens the fragrance- combining with subtle touches of bergamot to create a lively- fresh- and juicy bouquet. At the heart- seductive notes of rich coffee are blended with charming iris. Finally- the warm base of vanilla and patchouli lends a tactile- comforting quality- enveloping the senses in an opulent embrace.,Suggested Usage:-Fragrance is intensified by the warmth of your own body. Apply in the creases of your knees and elbows for a longer-lasting- stronger scent.Â -After applying- avoid rubbing or dabbing skin. This breaks down the fragrance- causing it to wear off more quickly.Â -If you prefer placing fragrance on your wrists- be sure to reapply after frequent hand-washing- as this tends to rinse off the scent.Â -Replace fragrance after 12 months. Expired perfumes more than a year old lose the integrity of the original scent. Eau de Toilette or Eau de Parfum?: The difference lies in the volume of perfume oil. While EDT contains five to nine percent- EDP contains more- usually eight to 14 percent. EDPs- therefore- last longer and smell more intense.,unknown,0,0,0,0
